# Architecture Overview (Draft)

This document is a placeholder for the upcoming architecture notes. It will outline:

- Data flow between the Telegram ingestion service, PostgreSQL (Supabase) and the API.
- Batch vs warm ingestion strategies with APScheduler.
- Frontend integration and deployment topology (Vercel + Railway + Supabase).

Update this file once implementation details are finalised.
