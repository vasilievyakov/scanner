# Deployment Guide (Draft)

Deployment steps will be documented here for:

- Backend (Railway) including environment configuration and secrets management.
- Frontend (Vercel) including environment variables and build settings.
- Supabase setup (database URL, service role key, SQL migrations).

Track external setup progress outside of the repository and update this guide accordingly.
