# Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend will be implemented with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and the shadcn/ui component library. This directory currently contains placeholders only.

Planned high-level pages:

- `/` — channel list with the ability to add new channels.
- `/channels/[id]` — channel detail view with searchable post feed and AI summaries.

Once the implementation starts, initialise the project with `pnpm create next-app` (or similar) and move the generated files into this folder. Remember to consume the shared environment variables defined in the repository root `.env.example`.
